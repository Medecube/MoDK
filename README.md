W.I.P. adding random things to CDDA.

Tested on build: 10710

  Hello, I'm Medecube. This mod is mostly comprised of some stuff I want to add to the game, either for me or for people who don't have time/patience to do it. I do this out of respect for the devs of the game: so that no one nags them about something they did, because I for one agree with their choices.


  At the moment, there isn't much. Just revamping the obsolete laser turret, and giving it fusion power instead of solar. PLEASE, please, if you encounter a problem or a bug, contact me on discord (I'm in both the official CDDA channel and the community one) OR raise an issue. You can do that if you have a suggestion too. 
  
Progression through this mod:


  A. Chems:
  
  (NOTE: All these recipes are unlocked by reading the Research note on fusion.)
  
  
  1. Hydrogen Sulfide
    
      Created by adding more sulfur to the mess the animals leave behind them, letting it rot and absorbing the emanated gass with your chemistry set. It's a long craft.
      
      
   2. Heavy Water
    
      ~20% Deuterium, not very useful for nuclear stuff yet. Quite time-consuming to obtain in large quantities. Not so safe for consumption, but a sip shouldn't hurt that much.
      
      
   3. Reactor Grade Heavy Water
    
      Now, this where the fun starts. This RG-HW stuff is used in cooling nuclear reactors. 99% of its Hydrogen atoms were replaced with its isotope, Deuterium. However, we still have no use for it yet (and it's even worse for you to drink it!)
      
      
   4. Deuterium
    
      Almost pure Hydrogen isotope. Very unhealthy, but can be used in fusion reactors.
   
   
  B.Misc
  
  
   1. Vial - Container
   
      One step closer to blasting like a stormtrooper. This tiny vial should hold enough deuterium to blast through 5-10 zombies, depending on how skilled you are.
      
      
   2. Deuterium Vial - Ammo
    
      Now this should be compatible with a weapon. Now only to find one...
      
   3. Linked Vials - Mag
   
      You can't just throw all the vials in the reactor, this makes it more controlable.
      
   4. Coconut IV - Medicine
   
      Now with a coconut and a hose you can make your own post-apocalyptic IV. (Syringe not included, find one to use the IV)
      

  C.Weapons and Turrets
  
  
   1. Experimental Laser Cannon
    
      Let's be honest: no matter how Rambo your survivor is, he didn't work with CERN or The Pentagon. You have to scavange this weapon from somewhere. During the first days of the Cataclysm, rumors were heard about helicopter convoys transporting prototype weapons to military bases.
      
      
   2. Laser Turret
    
      The mini reactor of the Turret makes it more suitable for use than carrying aroung your portable nuclear bomb. 
      
    
   3. Prototype Laser Pistol
      
      The first test of the portable fusion reactor on a weapon. It has a smaller magazine than the Cannon, but it is less bulkier. It was a work in progress before the Cataclysm started, but because of its small magazine and low rate of fire, a better weapon had to be produced.
      
   

Now maintaining: Hydroponics!
