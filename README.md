W.I.P. adding random things to CDDA.


  Hello, I'm Medecube. This mod is mostly comprised of some stuff I want to add to the game, either for me or for people who don't have time/patience to do it.


  At the moment, there isn't much. Just revamping the obsolete laser turret, and giving it fusion power instead of solar.
Progression through this mods:


  A. Chems:
  
  (NOTE: All these recipes are unlocked by reading the Advanced Chemistry Book. I'll work on adding another book dedicated to these chems.)
  
  
  1. Hydrogen Sulfide
    
      Created by adding more sulfur to the mess the animals leave behind them, letting it rot and absorbing the emanated gass with your chemistry set. It's a long craft.
      
      
   2. Heavy Water
    
      ~20% Deuterium, not very useful for nuclear stuff yet. Quite time-consuming to obtain in large quantities. Not so safe for consumption, but a sip shouldn't hurt that much.
      
      
   3. Reactor Grade Heavy Water
    
      Now, this where the fun starts. This RG-HW stuff is used in cooling nuclear reactors. It's 99% of the Hydrogen atoms were replaced with it's isotope. However, we still have no use for it yet (and it's even worse for you to drink it!)
      
      
   4. Deuterium
    
      Almost pure Hydrogen isotope. Very unhealthy, but can be used in fusion reactors.
   
   
  B.Misc
  
  
   1. Vial - Container
   
      One step closer to blasting like a stormtrooper. This tiny vial should hold enough deuterium to blast through 5-10 zombies, depending on how skilled you are.
      
      
   2. Deuterium Vial - Magazine
    
      Now this should be compatible with a weapon. Now only to find one...
      
      
  C.Weapons and Turrets
  
  
   1. Laser Cannon
    
      Let's be honest: no matter how Rambo your survival is, he didn't work with CERN or The Pentagon. You have to scavange this weapon from somewhere. During the first days of the Cataclysm, rumors were heard about helicopter convoys transporting prototype weapons to military bases.
      
      
   2. Laser Turret
    
      The mini reactor of the Turret makes it more suitable for use than carrying aroung your portable nuclear bomb.
